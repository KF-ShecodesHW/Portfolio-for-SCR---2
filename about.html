        My Origin Story
      </h3>
      <p class="origin-story-text">
        I grew up in Toronto, Canada, and always knew I wanted to be creative in
        some capacity. I gravitated towards art and design because, from a young
        age, I had the natural ability to draw. I also would figure out how to
        use any medium put in front of me with relative ease.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2010, I enrolled in the Industrial Design Program at Humber College.
        In school, I developed my skills in concept design, 3D CAD, and building
        prototypes. I did an internship that made me fall in love with agency
        environments and client-facing work. In 2014, I was one of the only
        women who graduated from that program that year.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my five-year career in Industrial Design, I worked with small
        businesses and big brands. I helped my clients fulfill their creative
        visions online and in retail stores. I would discuss design briefs that
        defined criteria, project scope, and deadlines. I'd then adhere to brand
        guidelines while also providing innovative solutions. I collaborated
        with different departments and helped guide projects from concept to
        production.

            UX Design
          </h3>
          <p class="text pt-3">
            In 2018, I worked on a project that introduced me to the world of
            User Experience Design - UX for short. The concept was an app for a
            design competition within the company I worked at, and it pushed me
            to go back to school in 2019. I attended George Brown College, where
            I got my certificate in UX Design, and then the pandemic hit.
            Finding work was hard at first, but eventually I did a lot of
            content creation and website design for many local brands that
            needed help getting their businesses to pivot online. I freelanced
            for two years before landing a full-time User Experience design role
            at a large tech company - which is what I am doing now.

              </h3>
              <p class="text">
                Many people interested in UX design ask me if I need to know how
                to code to be a UX designer. The short answer is no, but I
                wanted to learn how my designs get built and how developers do
                what they do. I also wanted to establish better working
                relationships with other developers when I worked with them. As
                someone who loves branding, components and user interface
                design, I found learning code changed the way I design and see
                website development. I took SheCodes because I am also all for
                more women's representation in the tech industry, and Matt and
                the SheCodes team are all great at what they do. I have learned
                a lot and am comfortable with coding enough that I have fun
                creating designs and then building them in HTML, CSS, Javascript
                and Bootstrap. I even started using my knowledge of HTML and CSS
                at work and participating in side projects coding websites and
                apps.
